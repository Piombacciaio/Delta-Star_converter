<br>
Ever had to manually convert a star connection into a delta or vice-versa?
<br>
If you had, you'll know that working with different resistors is a pain in the <i><s>ass</s></i>.
<br>
Well, I got bored of calculating it by hand and so I made this script to make it faster

<h3>Instrucions</h3>
- Choose an operation [Star to Delta or Delta to Star]<br>
- Insert the values of the resistors [exclude the omega and use periods instead of commas]<br>
- Double check the bindings<br>
- Voilà, you have the result ;)
